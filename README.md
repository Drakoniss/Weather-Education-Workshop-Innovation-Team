Weather-Education-Workshop-Innovation-Team (WEWIT)
==================================================


We aim to create content for an environmental sciences course. We will create a complete presentation where we will define the basic concepts of the urban heat island, climate change and how we can monitor climate within the cities. The approach is merely educational and will be presented to our university faculty in order to create awareness and introduce this topic in the environmental studies curriculum.

The course runs from the introduction of the terms urban heat island, climate change, the creation of microclimates up to the establishment of the designs for building the elements that has part in a sensor network for monitoring or supervisising variables like temperature and relative humidity. With this we aim to determine how are these variables affecting energy consumption, public health and human comfort in urban areas.

We answer questions related to the Urban Heat Island phenomena, how to determine the problem and how to revert it's effects. Prevention is not possible at this point so reducing consumption of fuels and the need for air conditioners will help revert the temperature increase in a more effective way. We plan to present this to the Architecture Faculty to promote new environmental courses related to this problems. Also some engineering courses related to the creation of urban sensor networks to gather data that will support new initiatives in reducing the already increasing temperatures within the cities.

Objectives:
- Create awareness of the urban heat island effect, where it comes from, implications and technological tools to model    and control it's effects.
- Define concepts of the urban heat island, climate change and sensor networks.
- Discuss the implications of the increase in temperature due to human activities within the cities.
- Learn how to design and create an operative sensor network and the applications that will gather the information        needed to model and analyze the situation within the cities. 


Course Synopsis

    Part 1: Climate and Environment
            Defines basic concepts of climate, environment, urban heat island and climate change.
    Part 2: Heat Dynamics
            Heat waves, how they work?
            Defining the required concepts to understand how heat waves move through the cities.
    Part 3: Heat Effects
            How heat affects humans, side effects of heat waves.
    Part 4: Tools to reduce heat effects
            Review of all tools, methods and policies that should be implemented in order to control and reduce the                 problem
    Part 5: Tell everybody about the problem
            How to inform the population about the issue, understand how the heat problem may affect them. Spread the               word
    Part 6: Short range sensor networks design and deployment
            Requirements, design and implementation of sensor networks for monitoring the urban heat island's                       temperature increase and create alarms that will alert of the situation.
